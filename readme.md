# Pass The Minions
Pass the Minions takes inspiration from Winning Moves Games' popular title Pass The Pigs. The object is to be the first to score 100 points using "Minions" as dice. I made this client-side game for my first project of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.

## About
Pass the Minions is designed to be played with 2 to 4 players. Players roll both Minions and points are scored according to the position of the Minions. After rolling, the player can decide whether to stop rolling and "bank" the score, or to keep rolling to try and add points to the score. If the player rolls one Silly Minion and one Bored Minion, also known as Pass the Minions, the player loses all of the points accumulated in this turn and the turn ends. The first player to score 100 points wins the game.
